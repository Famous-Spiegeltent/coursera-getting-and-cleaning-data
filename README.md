# Course Project for Getting and Cleaning Data

### The objective of this project is to obtain, work with, and clean a data set to prepare a tidy data set that can be used for analysis later.

### Here are the required steps before you run run_analysis.R:

1. Download the data file from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
2. Put the following files in the working directory:
	X_train.txt
	y_train.txt
	X_test.txt
	y_test.txt
	subject_train.txt
	subject_test.txt
	features.txt
	activity_labels.txt
3. Install reshape2 package.

### The output of this R code is a tidy data set. More details about the data set and the variables can be found in the code book.
